    The IPL rulebook covers a lot of ground, but here's a breakdown of some key areas:

<h2>Match format and scoring:</h2>

It's a Twenty20 format, so each team gets 20 overs to bat.
Teams get points for winning (2 points) and nothing for losing.
Net Run Rate (NRR) is used if teams have the same points after the group stage.
Play-offs involve four teams in a knock-out format.

<h2>Playing conditions:</h2>

There are strategic timeouts for each team during an innings.
The new rule for 2024 allows bowlers up to two bouncers (fast short-pitched deliveries) per over.
A new Smart Replay System is being used for reviewing umpiring decisions.
The "Impact Player" rule, introduced earlier, lets teams bring in a substitute mid-match.

<h2>Team management and finances:</body>/<h2>

There's a salary cap for each team's entire squad.
Player auctions and trading windows happen before the tournament.
There are rules regarding under-19 player eligibility.
